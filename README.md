# Fetal Health Classification Using Decision Trees and Random Forest

This project applies machine learning techniques to classify fetal health status based on cardiotocographic measurements. It was developed as part of the **Machine Learning with Python** module in the **Bangkit 2024** program.

## üìä Project Overview

The dataset includes features derived from cardiotocograms, which are used to assess fetal well-being. The classification targets are:
- **Normal**
- **Suspect**
- **Pathological**

The project involves:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Dimensionality Reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Classification using Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
